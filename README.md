# Face Mask Detection - Object Detection

## Description
This project focuses on face mask detection using object detection techniques. The model is designed to classify whether a person is wearing a mask or not, using deep learning-based image processing. This is especially relevant in health and safety applications, such as ensuring compliance with mask mandates in public places.

The model is trained using a labeled dataset containing images of people with and without masks. It utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) for object detection and classification. The implementation is done using TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, and other essential libraries.

## Installation
Before running the project, ensure that you have all the required dependencies installed. The easiest way to do this is by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Dependencies include:
- TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning model training and inference)
- OpenCV (for image processing and real-time face detection)
- NumPy (for numerical operations)
- Pandas (for dataset manipulation)
- Matplotlib (for visualizing training progress and results)

Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed to run the `.ipynb` file:

```bash
pip install jupyter
```

## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-mask-detection.git
cd face-mask-detection
```

2. Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook "Face Mask Detection - Object Detection.ipynb"
```

4. Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to train and evaluate the model.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled images of people wearing masks and those without masks. The dataset is sourced from various public image repositories or manually collected and annotated.

### Preprocessing Steps:
- Image resizing to a fixed dimension (e.g., 224x224 pixels)
- Image augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, and brightness adjustments
- Normalization to improve model performance
- Splitting into training, validation, and test sets

## Model Training & Evaluation
The face mask detection model is built using a CNN architecture trained on labeled images. The training process includes:

- Defining the CNN model architecture
- Compiling with an appropriate optimizer (e.g., Adam) and loss function (e.g., categorical crossentropy)
- Training the model on labeled images for multiple epochs
- Evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

### Hyperparameters:
- Batch size: 32
- Learning rate: 0.001
- Number of epochs: 25-50 (depending on dataset size)
- Activation function: ReLU (hidden layers), Softmax (output layer)

### Evaluation Metrics:
- **Accuracy**: Measures overall correctness of predictions.
- **Precision & Recall**: Evaluates class-specific performance.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Displays misclassifications.

## Results & Visualization
The trained model detects faces in images and determines whether they are wearing masks. Key outputs include:

- Bounding boxes around detected faces
- Labels: "Mask" or "No Mask"
- Probability scores for each classification

### Accuracy & Loss Graphs:
Training accuracy and loss plots are generated to evaluate model performance over epochs.

### Example Detections:
Images with model-predicted labels are displayed for visual inspection.

## Challenges & Future Improvements
### Challenges:
- Handling occlusions (e.g., sunglasses, scarves, or multiple masks)
- Dataset imbalance (more images of one class than the other)
- Real-time performance optimization

### Future Improvements:
- Implementing real-time face mask detection using webcam integration
- Using Transfer Learning with pre-trained models like MobileNetV2
- Deploying the model as a web or mobile application
